### Jupyter NBRequirements

This extension is a Jupyter Notebook dependency manager which provides control over the notebook dependencies.

The main goals of the project are the following:

- To create a notebook with its requirements embedded within it without leaving the notebook
- To provide a unique and optimized<sup>*</sup> environment for each notebook
- To allow for easy sharing, deployment and execution of Jupyter notebooks

<sup>*</sup>The requirements are optimized using the Thoth resolution engine

Let's install the extension by issuing:

``pip install jupyter-nbrequirements``{{execute}}
